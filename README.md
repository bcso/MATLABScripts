MATLABScripts
=============

All my custom MATLAB scripts. Textfile conatins info on each file

SYDE 114 All Calculations Script File
Matrix inverse
Eigenvalues Eigenvectors
LU Factorization Permutation
How close to singular it is

SYDE 114 Conditional Number and Norm File
Matrix Inverse
Norms of Matrix and Matrix Inverse
Conditional Number of Matrix

SYDE 182 Sim182 is for the Final Project Simulation
Position, Velocity and Acceleration Graphs

SYDE 112 f and run and numintegrate
f is where the function goes
run is the code you run, after you update the parameteres
numintegrate does all the work. Does not need to be changed
NOTE: Will be adding new files that do it by only needing to edit one script.
